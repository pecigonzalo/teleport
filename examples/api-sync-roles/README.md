# Minimal API Client for Generating Roles

This is a minimal working example of a Teleport API client that generates
Teleport roles based on an external RBAC system, in this case, a Kubernetes
cluster. To use it, follow the setup steps in the [Teleport
documentation](https://goteleport.com/docs/api/rbac).
