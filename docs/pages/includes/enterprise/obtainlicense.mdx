The Teleport Auth Service reads a license file to authenticate your Teleport
Enterprise account.

To obtain your license file, navigate to your Teleport account dashboard and log
in. You can start at [teleport.sh](https://teleport.sh) and enter your Teleport
account name (e.g. my-company). After logging in you will see a "GENERATE
LICENSE KEY" button, which will generate a new license file and allow you to
download it.
