### No credential providers error

If you see the error `NoCredentialProviders: no valid providers in chain` in {{service}} Service logs then Teleport
is not detecting the required credentials to connect via AWS IAM permissions. Check whether
the credentials or security role has been applied in the machine running the Teleport {{service}} Service.

When running on EKS, this error may occur if the Teleport {{service}} Service
cannot access IMDSv2 when the PUT requests hop limit on the worker node
instance is set to 1. You can use the following commands to check the hop
limit:
```code
$ aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <node-instance-id> | grep HttpPutResponseHopLimit
                        "HttpPutResponseHopLimit": 1,
```
