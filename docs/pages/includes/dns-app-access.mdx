Teleport assigns a subdomain to each application you configure for Application
Access. For example, if you enroll Grafana as a resource, Teleport assigns the resource
to the `grafana.teleport.example.com` subdomain. 

If you host the Teleport cluster on your own network, you should update your DNS 
configuration to account for application subdomains.
You can update DNS in one of two ways: 

- Create a single DNS address (A) or canonical name (CNAME) record using wildcard substitution 
for the subdomain name. For example, create a DNS record with the name `*.teleport.example.com`. 
- Create a separate DNS address (A) or canonical name (CNAME) record for each application subdomain.

Modifying DNS ensures that the certificate authority—for example, Let's Encrypt—can issue a 
certificate for each subdomain and that clients can verify Teleport hosts regardless of the
application they are accessing.

If you use the Teleport cloud platform, no DNS updates are needed because your Teleport 
cluster automatically provides the subdomains and signed TLS certificates for your 
applications under your tenant address.
