### SSL SYSCALL error

You may encounter the following error when your local `psql` is not compatible
with newer versions of OpenSSL:
```code
$ tsh db connect --db-user postgres --db-name postgres postgres
psql: error: connection to server at "localhost" (::1), port 12345 failed: Connection refused
    Is the server running on that host and accepting TCP/IP connections?
connection to server at "localhost" (127.0.0.1), port 12345 failed: SSL SYSCALL error: Undefined error: 0
```

Please upgrade your local `psql` to the latest version.
