The available provisioning modes are:

* `off`: Disables user provisioning.

* `keep`: Enables user provisioning and disables users at session end. The user
  will be stripped of all roles and the user account will be locked.

* `best_effort_drop`: Enables user provisioning and, when the session ends,
  drops the user if no resources depend on it. In cases where any resource
  depends on the user, it falls back to disabling the user, mirroring the
  behavior of `keep` mode.
