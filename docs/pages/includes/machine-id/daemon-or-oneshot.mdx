Now, you must decide if you want to run `tbot` as a daemon or in one-shot mode.

In daemon mode, `tbot` runs continually, renewing the short-lived credentials
for the configured outputs on a fixed interval. This is often combined with a
service manager (such as systemd) in order to run `tbot` in the background.
This is the default behaviour of `tbot`.

In one-shot mode, `tbot` generates short-lived credentials and then exits. This
is useful when combining `tbot` with scripting (such as in CI/CD) as it allows
further steps to be dependent on `tbot` having succeeded. It is important to
note that the credentials will expire if not renewed and to ensure that the
TTL for the certificates is long enough to cover the length of the CI/CD job.

#### Configuring `tbot` as a daemon

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/daemon.mdx!)

#### Configuring `tbot` for one-shot mode

To use `tbot` in one-shot mode, modify `/etc/tbot.yaml` to add `oneshot: true`:

```yaml
version: v2
oneshot: true
auth_server: ...
```

Now, you should test your `tbot` configuration. When started, several log
messages will be emitted before it exits with status 0:

```code
$ export TELEPORT_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY=1
$ tbot start -c /etc/tbot.yaml
```

`TELEPORT_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY` enables the submission of anonymous usage
telemetry. This helps us shape the future development of `tbot`. You can disable
this by omitting this.
