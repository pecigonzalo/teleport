Next, attach the following policy to the IAM role or IAM user the Teleport
Application Service instance is using, which allows the Application Service to
assume the IAM roles:

```yaml
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Admonition type="tip">
You can make the policy more strict by providing specific IAM role resource
ARNs in the "Resource" field instead of using a wildcard.
</Admonition>
