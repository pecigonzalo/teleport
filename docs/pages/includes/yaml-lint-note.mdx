<Admonition type="note" title="YAML formatting">
    YAML is very sensitive to correct spacing. When specifying lists in a `values.yaml` file, you might find it 
    helpful to
    [use a linter](https://codebeautify.org/yaml-validator) to validate your YAML list and ensure that it is
    correctly formatted.
